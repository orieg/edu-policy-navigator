## **Our School Safety & Respect Protocol: Working Together for a Kind Campus**

**(Aligned with San Ramon Valley Unified School District Policies BP 5131.2, BP 5144 & Administrative Regulations AR 5131.2, AR 5144, AR 1312.3)**

Our Commitment:  
Every student deserves to feel safe, respected, and happy at our school, protected from physical, mental, and emotional harm. We are committed to creating a positive and supportive environment where everyone can learn, achieve, and develop self-discipline and personal responsibility. Bullying, harassment, hate violence, intimidation, and other unsafe actions are not allowed. Our approach focuses on positive support, prevention, and interventions to help students succeed, as outlined in SRVUSD Board Policies, Administrative Regulations, and California Law. Our school establishes and communicates clear rules for conduct and promotes a positive climate. This policy applies to actions at school, related to school, or even off-campus if they impact our school environment (BP 5131.2).  
What We Don't Allow (Our School Rules, District Policy & CA Law):  
We have clear rules against actions that hurt others physically or emotionally, whether through physical, written, verbal, visual, or electronic means. This includes:

* **Bullying:** Repeatedly being mean to someone on purpose where there's a power imbalance, intending to cause harm. This can be a single severe act or repeated acts. (Defined by BP 5131.2 & CA Ed Code § 48900(r)). Examples include:  
  * *Physical:* Hitting, kicking, pushing, tripping, taking/breaking things, mean gestures.  
  * *Verbal:* Teasing, name-calling, threats, inappropriate comments, saying or writing hurtful things.  
  * *Social/Relational:* Leaving others out on purpose, spreading rumors, embarrassing someone, telling others not to be friends with someone.  
  * *Cyberbullying:* Sending mean texts/messages/posts online, spreading rumors online, sharing embarrassing photos/videos, creating fake profiles, breaking into accounts.  
* **Harassment/Sexual Harassment:** Unkind actions or words targeting someone because of their race, religion, gender, disability, or other personal characteristics, or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. (Defined by BP 5131.2, aligns with CA Ed Code § 48900(u) & anti-discrimination laws)  
* **Hate Violence, Threats, Intimidation:** Actions motivated by bias or intended to cause fear or harm. (BP 5131.2)  
* **Unsafe Actions:** Hitting, pushing, threats, damaging property, or other actions that could cause harm or seriously disrupt school. (Aligns with various sections of CA Ed Code § 48900\)  
* **Retaliation:** Treating someone badly because they reported an incident or helped in an investigation. (BP 5131.2)

These behaviors are taken very seriously because they harm our school community and violate school rules, SRVUSD policy, and California Education Code. *Disciplinary actions will never involve denying a student a meal or denying recess unless a student's presence poses an immediate safety threat (BP 5144, Ed Code 49056, 49557.5). Staff who permit or engage in bullying or retaliation are subject to disciplinary action (BP 5131.2).*

See Something, Say Something\! How to Report:  
If you see something unkind or unsafe happening, or if it happens to you, please tell an adult\! Reporting helps keep everyone safe.

* **Students:** Tell your teacher, yard duty, counselor, principal, or any trusted adult at school right away. Confidential or anonymous reporting options may be available.  
* **Parents/Guardians:** Contact your child's teacher, the school counselor, or the principal if you have concerns. Please report incidents as soon as possible.  
* **Written/Online:** Our school and district provide specific reporting forms or online tools (check school/district website). *If reporting cyberbullying, please save or print messages/posts if possible (AR 5131.2).*  
* **Formal Complaint Option:** You also have the right to file a formal complaint using the district's **Uniform Complaint Procedures (UCP)**, especially if you believe unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying based on a protected characteristic (like race, gender, disability, religion, etc.) occurred. Information and forms are available on the SRVUSD website or from the District Compliance Officer (AR 1312.3).

**It is safe to report.** We do not allow anyone to be treated badly for reporting a concern in good faith (retaliation is prohibited per BP 5131.2).

**What Happens Next? Our Process for Making Things Right:**

1. **Stop & Report:** Any school staff member who sees or learns about an incident will step in immediately (when safe) to make sure everyone is safe. They are required to report it to the Principal or Assistant Principal **within one school day** (AR 5131.2).  
2. **Looking Into It:** The Principal (or a trained designee) will investigate all complaints promptly and thoroughly, typically starting within a few school days. This involves trying to understand the causes of the behavior and talking separately and privately with the students involved (those targeted, those alleged to have caused harm, and witnesses).  
   * **Documentation:** All formal investigations and the interventions used are documented according to district procedures. Legally required alternatives ("Other Means of Correction") are documented in student records when applicable (AR 5144). Less formal resolutions handled directly by staff may be noted in communication logs or teacher records; however, patterns of such behavior will be reviewed and may lead to formal investigation and documentation.  
   * **Process:** *The Principal notifies the district compliance officer within two school days of receiving a report (AR 5131.2). If behavior might be related to an unidentified disability, a referral for assessment may be made (AR 5144). **If the complaint alleges unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying based on protected characteristics, it will be investigated and resolved according to the district's Uniform Complaint Procedures (UCP \- AR 1312.3).** If an investigation of non-discriminatory bullying reveals potential discrimination, the UCP process will be followed. For other bullying incidents, the Principal will take action to resolve the complaint as outlined here (BP 5131.2).*  
3. **Making Things Right & Supporting Students:** Our goal is to stop the behavior, repair any harm, ensure student safety, and help students learn better ways to interact, keeping their well-being and learning opportunity in mind (BP 5144). We prioritize strategies that keep students in school.  
   * **Support for Students Targeted:** We will focus on making sure the student feels safe, offering support from the counselor, school psychologist, social worker, or other support staff, and creating a plan (including safety measures if needed) to prevent it from happening again. *For victims of racist bullying, we will also check in regularly to support their well-being (AR 5144, Ed Code 48900.5). Parents/guardians of students who are victims of bullying may be advised of the option to request a transfer to another school (BP 5131.2, Ed Code 46600).*  
   * **Understanding & Changing Behavior (for Students Causing Harm):** We work to understand *why* the behavior happened. Corrective actions focus first on counseling, behavioral intervention, education, and other positive strategies ("Other Means of Correction" per AR 5144 & Ed Code 48900.5) like:  
     * Discussions/conferences with student, staff, and parents/guardians.  
     * Referrals to counselor or support staff for case management.  
     * Using study teams or guidance teams to create individual support plans.  
     * Teaching skills like managing anger, solving problems peacefully, understanding feelings (SEL), and communicating respectfully (Inspired by CPS & SEL).  
     * Restorative conversations or practices to help repair relationships when appropriate and safe.  
     * **For racist bullying:** Requiring participation in restorative justice practices and culturally sensitive programs promoting racial justice and equity (AR 5144, Ed Code 48900.5).  
     * **Important Note:** We focus on these supportive and educational interventions *before* considering suspension, especially in elementary grades, as required by CA Ed Code § 48900.5 and SRVUSD policy BP 5144/AR 5144\. These alternatives are documented.  
   * **Consequences:** Actions have consequences. Depending on the findings of the investigation (what happened, how serious or pervasive it was), the student's age, history, and whether alternatives have been tried and documented, consequences will be fair, age-appropriate, and aim to help the student learn. They can range from discussions and skill-building to loss of privileges, detention, community service (per AR 5144), or, for serious or repeated offenses defined by CA Ed Code § 48900 where alternatives haven't worked or aren't appropriate according to law and district policy, suspension. We will always follow SRVUSD disciplinary procedures and state law (CA Ed Code § 48900 & § 48900.5).  
   * **Supporting Witnesses:** We help witnesses understand their role as "upstanders" who can help create a positive school climate and how to report safely.  
   * **Referrals & Safety:** Students involved (victim, perpetrator, witness) may be referred to school support services. *If any student shows signs of wanting to harm themselves or others, safety protocols (including potential mental health or law enforcement contact) will be followed immediately (AR 5131.2, BP/AR 5141.52).*

Working Together:  
We believe in partnering with parents and guardians and building strong, cooperative relationships. The Principal or designee will communicate with the parents/guardians of students involved as appropriate and required by privacy laws and SRVUSD policy. We encourage families to model respectful behavior, contribute to a safe environment, and monitor potential causes of bullying (BP 5131.2). Your support at home is crucial.  
**Parent/Guardian Communication:** We are committed to timely communication.

* For **emergencies or serious incidents** involving student safety or significant injury, parents/guardians will be contacted as soon as possible, typically by phone on the same day.  
* For other confirmed incidents requiring follow-up or intervention, the Principal or designee will communicate with parents/guardians in a timely manner (usually within 1-2 school days), often starting with a phone call or email, depending on the situation.  
* Communication will respect student privacy laws while providing necessary information about the incident and the school's response.

Learning & Growing:  
Our school uses programs and lessons to teach all students about kindness, empathy, respect, resolving conflicts peacefully, digital citizenship, appropriate online behavior, and understanding differences (AR 5131.2). We work together with students, staff, and families to build a positive school culture every day. All staff receive regular training on this protocol, bullying prevention/intervention, diversity, and positive classroom management (AR 5131.2). Information and resources are available on the district website.  
**Using Data to Support Students:** School administration and support teams periodically review documented incident information. This helps us identify patterns (like repeated issues involving specific students or locations), understand potential student distress, ensure follow-through, and adjust our prevention and support strategies to better meet student needs.

Our Promise:  
We follow this protocol consistently and fairly, always keeping student safety and well-being our top priority, in alignment with San Ramon Valley Unified School District policies (especially BP 5131.2, BP 5144, AR 5131.2, AR 5144, AR 1312.3), nondiscrimination policies, and the California Education Code.
