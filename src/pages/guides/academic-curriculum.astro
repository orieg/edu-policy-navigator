        Here is a candidate list of questions to ask your school principal or
        administration to understand the school's approach to academic quality,
        curriculum, and student learning. Each question includes a rationale to
        help guide your conversation.

        Can you provide an overview of the core curriculum used in each grade
        level, and how it aligns with State Standards (e.g., Common Core for
        ELA/Math, Next Generation Science Standards, or other relevant state
        standards)?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Ensures understanding of what your
        child will be learning and its alignment with state-wide educational goals.

        ensured, especially in early grades?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Literacy is foundational. Understanding
        the approach helps parents support their child's reading and writing development.

        conceptual understanding, problem-solving, and procedural fluency? What
        curriculum or resources are primarily used?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Math skills build sequentially. Knowing
        the instructional approach helps parents understand how concepts are introduced
        and reinforced.
    </p>

        learning opportunities?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Ensures that all students are appropriately
        challenged and supported to reach their full potential.
    </p>

    <h2 id="assessment-feedback">Assessment and Feedback</h2>
