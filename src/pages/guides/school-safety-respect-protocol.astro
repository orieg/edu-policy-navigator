    <p>
        Here is a candidate list of questions to ask your school principal or
        administration to understand the school's approach to student safety,
        behavior (including conflicts), and creating a positive school climate.
        Each question includes a rationale to help guide your conversation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="defining-differentiating-behaviors">
        Defining & Differentiating Behaviors
    </h2>
    <p>
        How does the school define and differentiate between bullying and other
        forms of peer conflict, such as isolated disagreements or physical
        altercations? What are the different intervention pathways for each type
        of incident? (CA Ed Code ยง 48900(r))
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Ensures clarity on how different
        behaviors are categorized and addressed, recognizing that not all conflicts
        are bullying but still require intervention.
    </p>

    <h2 id="handling-physical-conflict">Handling Physical Conflict</h2>
    <p>
        What specific steps are taken immediately following a physical conflict
        (e.g., hitting, pushing) between students, even if it's not classified
        as bullying? How does the school ensure immediate safety and then
        address the root cause?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Understands the school's immediate
        response protocol for physical incidents to ensure student safety and de-escalation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="reporting-process">
        Reporting Process for Students & Parents/Reporters
    </h2>
    <p>
        What specific steps should a student take if they feel unsafe, witness
        unkindness, or are involved in a conflict? What is the best way for
        parents (or other concerned parties) to report concerns, who is the
        primary contact, and what kind of acknowledgment or general follow-up
        can a reporting party expect? Can you provide information on formal
        complaint options, like the Uniform Complaint Procedures?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Clarity on reporting channels for
        all parties, expected communication for reporters, and access to formal processes
        is crucial for timely and transparent intervention.
    </p>

    <h2 id="investigation-follow-up">Investigation & Follow-Up</h2>
    <p>
        Once any concern (bullying or conflict) is reported, can you walk me
        through the typical investigation process? Who investigates, what is the
        general timeframe, and how is the situation documented?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Helps parents understand the procedure,
        timeline, and record-keeping involved when an incident is addressed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="intervention-support-strategies">
        Intervention & Support Strategies (Focus on Alternatives)
    </h2>
    <p>
        What positive supports, counseling, conflict resolution skill-building,
        or restorative practices does the school prioritize for all types of
        incidents before considering consequences? How are these alternatives
        documented, especially considering legal requirements? (CA Ed Code ยง
        48900.5)
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Determines the school's focus on
        teaching and support versus punitive measures, aligning with best practices
        and legal mandates for students.
    </p>

    <h2 id="support-targeted-students">
        Support for Targeted Students & Student Voice
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a child has been targeted or negatively affected by an incident, what
        specific supports does the school offer to help them feel safe and
        emotionally supported? How is their voice incorporated into finding a
        resolution or determining what helps them feel safe again? Is there a
        process for creating a safety plan, and could you give some examples of
        what measures it might include at the relevant school level? (Ed Code
        46600)
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Focuses on the well-being, safety,
        agency, and available resources for the child experiencing harm or distress,
        including concrete examples of support.
    </p>

    <h2 id="addressing-behavior-teaching-alternatives">
        Addressing Behavior & Teaching Alternatives
    </h2>
    <p>
        How does the school work with students involved in an incident to help
        them understand the impact, take responsibility, and learn alternatives
        like peaceful conflict resolution or managing emotions? (Ed Code
        48900.5)
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Seeks to understand the school's
        approach to behavioral change and skill development for the student causing
        harm.
    </p>

    <h2 id="assessing-risk-repetition">Assessing Risk of Repetition</h2>
    <p>
        Following any significant incident, what process does the school use to
        assess the risk of the behavior repeating? How does this assessment
        inform the follow-up monitoring and support plan for all students
        involved?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Understands how the school proactively
        evaluates and plans to prevent future occurrences of negative behavior.
    </p>

    <h2 id="range-of-consequences">Range of Consequences</h2>
    <p>
        While the focus is on positive interventions, can you provide a general
        overview of the range of consequences the school might consider for
        different types of incidents โ from minor conflicts to more serious or
        repeated behaviors โ in line with district policy and Ed Code?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Provides clarity on the school's
        accountability framework and the spectrum of potential responses to various
        behaviors.
    </p>

    <h2 id="parent-communication">Parent Communication</h2>
    <p>
        Under what circumstances, and how quickly, can parents expect
        notification if their child is involved in a significant safety
        incident, bullying, or conflict? What level of detail is typically
        provided, respecting privacy laws?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Sets clear expectations for timely
        and appropriate communication between the school and parents regarding incidents.
    </p>

    <h2 id="confidentiality-privacy-laws">
        Confidentiality Management & Privacy Laws
    </h2>
    <p>
        How does the school ensure the confidentiality of all students involved
        during and after an investigation (including the reporter, those
        targeted, those who caused harm, and witnesses), consistent with student
        privacy laws like FERPA and relevant California Education Code
        provisions? What information is shared with staff, and on what basis?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Addresses concerns about privacy
        and ensures understanding of how sensitive information is handled and protected
        according to legal requirements.

        Proactive Prevention & Education
    </h2>
    <p>
        What specific programs, lessons, or assemblies does the school implement
        across grade levels to proactively teach students about kindness,
        empathy, respect, conflict resolution strategies, and digital
        citizenship?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Shows the school's commitment to
        building a positive school culture and equipping students with social-emotional
        skills.
    </p>

    <h2 id="staff-training-consistency">Staff Training & Consistency</h2>
    <p>
        How are all staff members (teachers, supervisors, support staff) trained
        to consistently recognize, intervene, and report various types of safety
        concerns according to the school's approach?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Ensures that all adults interacting
        with students are knowledgeable, equipped, and aligned in their response
        to incidents.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ensuring-thorough-objective-investigations">
        Ensuring Thorough & Objective Investigations
    </h2>
    <p>
        When investigating incidents, especially those with conflicting
        accounts, what steps are taken to ensure all perspectives are thoroughly
        explored and objectively considered before determining findings or next
        steps?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Addresses concerns about potential
        dismissal or gaslighting by focusing on the process for gathering and weighing
        all information fairly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="maintaining-impartiaility">Maintaining Impartiality</h2>
    <p>
        What procedures or safeguards does the school have in place to ensure
        impartiality during investigations and decision-making, ensuring
        fairness for all students involved, regardless of who they are?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">

        against potential bias or favoritism, focusing on fairness in the process
        itself.
    </p>

    <h2 id="managing-conflicts-of-interest">
        Managing Potential Conflicts of Interest
    </h2>
    <p>
        How does the school address potential conflicts of interest if a staff
        member involved in handling an incident might have a pre-existing
        relationship (e.g., neighbor, friend) with one of the families involved?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">

        environment?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Addresses the reality that student
        conflicts and digital interactions often extend beyond school grounds and
        hours but still affect the school climate.
    </p>

    <h2 id="measuring-effectiveness-trends">
        Measuring Effectiveness & Identifying Trends
    </h2>
    <p>
        How does the school track different types of safety and respect
        incidents? Is this data, or perhaps school climate survey results, used
        to identify patterns and measure the overall effectiveness of the
        school's approach over time?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Understands how the school monitors

        Transition Between Grades (Internal)
    </h2>
    <p>
        When students move to the next grade level within this school, how is
        relevant information about past significant safety incidents, conflicts,
        or support plans communicated between the current and receiving teachers
        to ensure continuity of care and awareness?
    </p>
    <p class="rationale">
        <strong>Why this is important:</strong> Ensures that important context and
        support strategies aren't lost during internal grade transitions, promoting
        consistent support for students year-to-year.
