Here is a candidate list of questions to ask your school principal or administration to understand the school's approach to academic quality, curriculum, and student learning. Each question includes a rationale to help guide your conversation.

## Curriculum Overview & Standards Alignment
Can you provide an overview of the core curriculum used in each grade level, and how it aligns with State Standards (e.g., Common Core for ELA/Math, Next Generation Science Standards, or other relevant state standards)?

> **Why this is important:** Ensures understanding of what your child will be learning and its alignment with state-wide educational goals.

## Literacy Instruction (Reading & Writing)
What is the school's approach to teaching reading and writing? What specific programs or methodologies are used (e.g., phonics-based, balanced literacy)? How is foundational reading skill development ensured, especially in early grades?

> **Why this is important:** Literacy is foundational. Understanding the approach helps parents support their child's reading and writing development.

## Mathematics Instruction
How is mathematics taught at the school? Is there an emphasis on conceptual understanding, problem-solving, and procedural fluency? What curriculum or resources are primarily used?

> **Why this is important:** Math skills build sequentially. Knowing the instructional approach helps parents understand how concepts are introduced and reinforced.

## Science and Social Studies Curriculum
How are science and social studies integrated into the curriculum? What is the frequency of instruction, and are there hands-on learning opportunities or project-based activities in these areas?

> **Why this is important:** Provides insight into how students learn about the world around them and develop inquiry skills.

## Teaching Methodologies & Classroom Environment
What teaching strategies are commonly used to engage students and foster a love of learning? How does the school encourage active participation, collaboration, and critical thinking in the classroom?

> **Why this is important:** The learning environment and teaching methods significantly impact student engagement and depth of understanding.

## Differentiated Instruction
How does the school identify and support the diverse learning needs of students, including those who may need extra help to meet grade-level standards and those who may benefit from more advanced or enriched learning opportunities?

> **Why this is important:** Ensures that all students are appropriately challenged and supported to reach their full potential.

## Assessment and Feedback
How is student learning assessed beyond standardized tests (e.g., classroom assignments, projects, observations)? How and how frequently do teachers provide feedback to students and parents on academic progress and areas for growth?

> **Why this is important:** Understanding assessment methods and feedback loops helps parents track progress and partner with teachers effectively.

## Homework Philosophy
What is the school's philosophy on homework for different grade levels? What is the expected purpose and typical amount of homework?

> **Why this is important:** Clarifies expectations regarding homework and its role in reinforcing learning.

## Technology Integration
How is technology integrated into the curriculum to enhance learning? What digital literacy skills are students taught, and how does the school ensure responsible and effective use of technology?

> **Why this is important:** Technology is a key part of modern education, and understanding its role helps assess digital preparedness.

## Development of Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving
How does the curriculum and teaching approach foster critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity across different subject areas?

> **Why this is important:** These higher-order skills are crucial for future success in academics and beyond.

## Preparation for Next Steps
How does each grade level prepare students for the academic expectations of the next grade? For upper grades, how does the school specifically prepare students for transitions to the next school level (e.g., elementary to middle, middle to high school)?

> **Why this is important:** Ensures a smooth academic transition and builds student confidence for future challenges.

## Teacher Professional Development
What opportunities do teachers have for ongoing professional development, particularly related to curriculum implementation, instructional best practices, and meeting diverse student needs?

> **Why this is important:** Well-supported and continuously learning teachers are key to a high-quality academic program.

## Alignment with District Goals
How do the school's academic programs and initiatives align with the broader goals and strategic plans of the local school district?

> **Why this is important:** Provides context on how the school fits into the larger district's educational vision and priorities.

## Parent Resources for Academic Support
What resources or guidance does the school offer to parents who want to support their child's academic learning at home (e.g., workshops, online resources, recommended reading)?

> **Why this is important:** Empowers parents to be effective partners in their child's education.

## Measuring & Communicating Academic Success
How does the school, as a whole, measure and evaluate its academic success beyond standardized test scores? How is this information shared with the school community?

> **Why this is important:** Understands the school's broader definition of academic achievement and its commitment to continuous improvement and transparency.
