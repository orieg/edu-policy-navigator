# Cursor Rules Location

## Purpose
This document defines the standards and requirements for placing and organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

## Directory Structure
All Cursor rule files MUST be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory at the project root:

```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
│       ├── another-rule.mdc
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

## File Naming Conventions
1. Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `your-rule-name.mdc`)
2. Always use `.mdc` file extension
3. Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose
4. Prefix with numbers for ordering (e.g., `00-`, `01-`, etc.)

## Placement Rules

### Required Location
- All rule files MUST be placed in `.cursor/rules/`
- No exceptions are allowed for placement in other directories

### Prohibited Locations
Do NOT place rule files in:
- Project root directory
- Subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`
- Any other location in the project

## File Organization

### Recommended Structure
Each rule file should contain:
1. Title (H1 heading)
2. Purpose/Description
3. Main content sections
4. Examples (if applicable)
5. Related rules (if any)

### Example Rule File Structure
```markdown
# Rule Name

## Purpose
Brief description of the rule's purpose.

## Main Content

## Examples
Example usage and implementations.

## Related Rules
Links to related rules.
```

   - Update rules when requirements change
   - Maintain consistent formatting

2. **Content Organization**
   - Use clear headings and sections
   - Include practical examples
   - Reference related rules
   - Keep content focused and concise

3. **Version Control**
   - Track changes to rules
   - Document major updates
   - Maintain change history
   - Use descriptive commit messages

## Validation
- Regularly review rule placement
- Ensure all rules follow naming conventions
- Verify rule content is up to date
- Check for broken references
